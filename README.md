# CS-598-Practical-Statistical-Learning
- Course Project for CS 598 - Practical Statistical Learning.
- Project done with the help of Yusuf Khan, given by course staff to build movie recommender systems based on the following:
  - System I - Recommendation Based on Genres. We were given the liberty to choose what characteristics made a movie popular. As discussed in the project, we chose 
    - Number of ratings,
    - Average rating above 3.5 stars,
    - and Minumum number of ratings to be considered.
  We believe these criteria manage to build a list that is accurate and reflects an overall sense of what the public beleive is a popular movie. Popular movies tend to have a higher number of ratings as many it has reached
  a larger audience. Combined with the average rating above 3.5 stars, the list is narrowed to high audience films with really good feedback. The final criteria allows us to explore older films, as newer films usually have
  lower number of ratings.



- Course Project for CS 427 - Software Engineering.
- Group project instructions given by course staff to develop an Android Studio application similar to a weather app. The app would allow users to create an account and log in, later, users would be presented with a UI allowing them to add a city from a database. This databses contained a large quantity of cities to be displayed as selectable items for each user to custumize their homepage. Selecting the city after being added would connect the app to an API service to retrieve basic weather statistics as well as show the map of the city.
- Further requirements were given as to test the application using assert statements. My contributions can mostly be found under app folder -> src folder -> main folder -> java folder -> edu folder -> uiuc folder -> cs427app folder under LoginActivity, RegisterActivity, and DBActivity files. Video files and links were provided to show the progress being made throughout the process.

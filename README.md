# CS-598-Practical-Statistical-Learning
- Course Project for CS 598 - Practical Statistical Learning.
- Project done with the help of Yusuf Khan, given by course staff to build movie recommender systems based on the following:
  - System I = Recommendation Based on Genres.


- Course Project for CS 427 - Software Engineering.
- Group project instructions given by course staff to develop an Android Studio application similar to a weather app. The app would allow users to create an account and log in, later, users would be presented with a UI allowing them to add a city from a database. This databses contained a large quantity of cities to be displayed as selectable items for each user to custumize their homepage. Selecting the city after being added would connect the app to an API service to retrieve basic weather statistics as well as show the map of the city.
- Further requirements were given as to test the application using assert statements. My contributions can mostly be found under app folder -> src folder -> main folder -> java folder -> edu folder -> uiuc folder -> cs427app folder under LoginActivity, RegisterActivity, and DBActivity files. Video files and links were provided to show the progress being made throughout the process.
